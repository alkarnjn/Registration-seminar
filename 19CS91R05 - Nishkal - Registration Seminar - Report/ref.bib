@article{Ahmed2018,
  abstract = {Technical advancement has popularized the usage of high dimensional data in many applications such as medical imaging, business processing, biometric based security, etc. In recent years, biometric application has gained its popularity significantly. Such an application system usually involved with voluminous databases of high dimensional data. An enormous size of database increases the cost of identification and degrades the system performance. To resolve such an issue a plethora of algorithms based on geometric hashing, k-d tree, k-means clustering, etc. have been proposed in the literature. Although, these algorithms solve a number of concomitant challenges of multi-dimensional data, yet, they fail to present a universal solution. In this paper, we propose an indexing mechanism, which partitions a data space effectively into zones and blocks using a set of hash functions. Further, the index locations are divided into maximum nine sub-locations to store data. This helps in carrying out efficient searching of the queried data thereby minimizing the false rejection rate. In order to validate the proposed approach, the proposed mechanism has been applied to the FVC and NIST fingerprint image databases. Our experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our approach in terms of accuracy, speed, reduction of search space and the number of comparisons to store and retrieve data.},

@article{Dey2016,
  abstract = {Biometric-based person identification is gaining its importance and now-a-days it is required to process a large amount of biometric data in the order of millions. As a consequence, the traditional approaches where the identity of a query template is decided by matching the query template with all stored templates are impractical. Further, the problem is compounded when we have to deal with two or more biometric traits. In this paper, we propose an approach to index a large pool of multi-biometric data so that the matching process can be accomplished in a real time without compromise in accuracy of person identification. Our proposed indexing technique is based on the relative scores. In our approach, the relative scores are calculated against a set of reference subjects corresponding to each trait. Next, we combine the scores using SVM based score level fusion technique. These scores are used to generate index key for a subject. Based on the index code values we store the subject identity into the database. We create index spaces in the database and store subjects' identities into table. The position in the table is calculated based on the relative index key values. At the time of querying, we retrieve a candidate set for a query index key corresponding to each biometric trait. We introduce a new rank level fusion technique on the retrieved candidate sets using SVM rank. The major contributions of this paper is generating index key based on relative scores and table-based index space organization which allow us to retrieve a small set of candidates by searching a small part of the database. Further, SVM-based rank level fusion gives accurate ranking among the retrieved candidates. The experimental results substantiate that our approach is capable of retrieving biometric data with a higher hit rate and lower penetration rate. We have experimented our approach with a set of virtual user database of size 2625. We achieve 99.55% hit rate with 17.77% penetration rate with this set of users. With our proposed approach, it is possible to retrieve a set of identities similar to the query template in the order of milliseconds and is independent of sizes of databases. Thus, the organization index space proves to be effective for fast and accurate retrieval. Moreover, our proposed approach can be extended for any number of biometric modalities.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an efficient indexing technique for fingerprint database using minutiae based geometric hashing. This technique consists of two stages, known as indexing and searching. For an accurate match at the time of searching, it has proposed a fixed length feature vector built from each minutia, known as Minutia Binary Pattern. Unlike any existing geometric based indexing technique, the proposed technique inserts each minutia along with the feature vector exactly once into a hash table. As a result, it reduces both computational and memory costs. Since minutiae of all fingerprint images in the database are found to be well distributed into the hash table, no rehashing is required. Experiments over FVC 2004 datasets prove the superiority of the proposed indexing technique against well known geometric based indexing techniques. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The image is firstly divided into eight bit-planes and the Gray-code of bit-planes is introduced to avoid the effect of changes in the intensity values on bit-planes. Then, an entropy vector is constructed by computing the entropy of the first four significant planes which contain most of the structural information of the image. Finally, with designing of the correlation-weighted matrix, the Mahalanobis distance is adopted to measure the similarity because of the correlation between the concerned vectors. Comparisons are conducted between BPDE and other descriptors. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more significantly retrieval results than the traditional ones. © 2008 IEEE.},

The object shape is captured by scanning the object image using a space-filling curve (SFC). The resulting vector is smoothed, using wavelet approximation, and sampled. In addition, the concept of key feature points (KFPs) is introduced to utilize a priori information about the classification of the images in the database in optimizing the representation of the objects within each class. The proposed technique achieves a recognition rate of 88.3% on the MPEG-7 core experiment part B. On the Kimia-99 and Kimia-216 datasets, a precision average of 95.6% is attained.

  abstract  = {Prevailing methods of human identification based on credentials (identification documents and PIN) are not able to meet the growing demands for stringent security in applications such as national ID cards, border crossings, government benefits, and access control. As a result, biometric recognition, or simply biometrics, which is based on physiological and behavioural characteristics of a person, is being increasingly adopted and mapped to rapidly growing person identification applications. Unlike credentials (documents and PIN), biometric traits (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) cannot be lost, stolen, or easily forged; they are also considered to be persistent and unique. Use of biometrics is not new; fingerprints have been successfully used for over 100 years in law enforcement and forensics to identify and apprehend criminals. But, as biometrics permeates our society, this recognition technology faces new challenges. The design and suitability of biometric technology for person identification depends on the application requirements. These requirements are typically specified in terms of identification accuracy, throughput, user acceptance, system security, robustness, and return on investment. The next generation biometric technology must overcome many hurdles and challenges to improve the recognition accuracy. These include ability to handle poor quality and incomplete data, achieve scalability to accommodate hundreds of millions of users, ensure interoperability, and protect user privacy while reducing system cost and enhancing system integrity. This chapter presents an overview of biometrics, some of the emerging biometric technologies and their limitations, and examines future challenges.},

Similarly, in terms of iris biometric matching, the eyes of identical twins are as different as irises of unrelated people. The left and right eyes of an individual or the eyes of identical twins are examples of genetically identical irises. In experiments with human observers viewing pairs of iris images acquired using an iris biometric system, we have found that there is recognizable similarity in the left and right irises of an individual and in the irises of identical twins.

The experimental dataset consists of images taken of 126 pairs of identical twins (252 people) collected on the same day and 24 pairs of identical twins (48 people) with images collected one year apart. In terms of both the number of paris of twins and lapsed time between acquisitions, this is the most extensive investigation of face recognition performance on twins to date. Recognition experiments are conducted using three of the top submissions to the Multiple Biometric Evaluation (MBE) 2010 Still Face Track [1]. Performance results are reported for both same day and cross year matching. Performance results are broken out by lighting conditions (studio and outside); expression (neutral and smiling); gender and age. Confidence intervals were generated by a bootstrap method. This is the most detailed covariate analysis of face recognition of twins to date. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The increase in twin births has created a requirement for biometric systems to accurately determine the identity
               of a person who has an identical twin. The discriminability of some of the identical twin biometric traits,
               such as fingerprints, iris, and palmprints, is supported by anatomy and the formation process of the biometric
               characteristic, which state they are different even in identical twins due to a number of random factors during
               the gestation period. For the first time, we collected multiple biometric traits (fingerprint, face, and iris) of
               66 families of twins, and we performed unimodal and multimodal matching experiments to assess the ability
               of biometric systems in distinguishing identical twins. Our experiments show that unimodal finger biometric
               systems can distinguish two different persons who are not identical twins better than they can distinguish identical
               twins; this difference is much larger in the face biometric system and it is not significant in the iris biometric
               system. Multimodal biometric systems that combine different units of the same biometric modality (e.g. multiple
               fingerprints or left and right irises.) show the best performance among all the unimodal and multimodal biometric
               systems, achieving an almost perfect separation between genuine and impostor distributions.},

Their performance highly depends on the distinctive information in the biometrics. Identical twins having the closest genetics-based relationship are expected to have maximum similarity in their biometrics. Classifying identical twins is a challenging problem for some automatic biometric systems. Palmprint has been studied for personal identification for over seven years. Most of the previous research concentrates on algorithm development. In this paper, we systemically examine palmprints from the same DNA for automatic personal identification and to uncover the genetically related palmprint features. The experimental results show that the three principal lines and some portions of weak lines are genetically related features but our palms still contain rich genetically unrelated features for classifying identical twins. © 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of systems requires reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that the rendered services are accessed only by a legitimate user and no one else. Examples of such applications include secure access to buildings, computer systems, laptops, cellular phones, and ATMs. In the absence of robust personal recognition schemes, these systems are vulnerable to the wiles of an impostor. Biometric recognition or, simply, biometrics refers to the automatic recognition of individuals based on their physiological and/or behavioral characteristics. By using biometrics, it is possible to confirm or establish an individual's identity based on "who she is," rather than by "what she possesses" (e.g., an ID card) or "what she remembers" (e.g., a password). In this paper, we give a brief overview of the field of biometrics and summarize some of its advantages, disadvantages, strengths, limitations, and related privacy concerns.},

  abstract = {Fingerprint verification is one of the most reliable personal identification methods. However manual fingerprint verification is so tedious time-consuming and expensive that it is incapable of meeting today's increasing performance requirements. An automatic fingerprint identification system (APIS) is widely needed. It plays a very important role in forensic and civilian applications such as criminal identification access control and ATM card verification. This paper describes the design and implementation of an on-line fingerprint verification system which operates in two stages: minutia extraction and minutia matching. An improved version of the minutia extraction algorithm proposed by Ratha et al. which is much faster and more reliable is implemented for extracting features from an input fingerprint image captured with an on-line inkless scanner. For minutia matching an alignment-based elastic matching algorithm has been developed. This algorithm is capable of finding the correspondences between minutiae in the input image and the stored template without resorting to exhaustive search and has the ability of adaptively compensating for the nonlinear deformations and inexact pose transformations between fingerprints. The system has been tested on two sets of fingerprint images captured with inkless scanners. The verification accuracy is found to be acceptable. Typically a complete fingerprint verification procedure takes on an average about eight seconds on a SPARC 20 workstation. These experimental results show that our system meets the response time requirements of on-line verification with high accuracy. © 1997 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines automated iris recognition as a biometrically based technology for personal identification and verification. The motivation for this endeavor stems from the observation that the human iris provides a particularly interesting structure on which to base a technology for noninvasive biometric assessment. In particular, the biomedical literature suggests that irises are as distinct as fingerprints or patterns of retinal blood vessels. Further, since the iris is an overt body, its appearance is amenable to remote examination with the aid of a machine vision system. The body of this paper details issues in the design and operation of such systems. For the sake of illustration, extant systems are described in some amount of detail. © 1997 IEEE.},
