\section{Work in progress and Future plan of work}
\label{work_in_prog}
We are currently improving the uniqueness of the extracted features. Using just the direct features, we are not able to get the same feature for different snapshots of a particular biometric. We propose using a combination of indirect and direct features.

The plan of work is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Creation of a virtual dataset for evaluation of traditional as well as proposed methods
    \item Extracting indirect features from a given biometric
    \item Using a combination of indirect and direct features for key generation.
    \item Generating an index space using the keys and analysing the search time and penetration rate for the index.
    \item Use of multi-index to further reduce the search time.
    \item Technique to combine multiple modalities of biometric to further improve the search time.
\end{enumerate}
